Wallabag v2 for Yunohost
------------------------

**This is a work-in-progress Wallabag v2 package for YunoHost. It's currently looking for new maintainer(s), so feel free to give a shout if you're interested in!**

**Shipped version:** 2.2.1

[Wallabag](https://www.wallabag.org/) is a self hostable application allowing
you to not miss any content anymore. Click, save, read it when you can. It
extracts content so that you can read it when you have time.

## Features

In addition to Wallabag core features, the following are made available with
this package:

 * Integrate with YunoHost users and SSO - i.e. logout button
 * Allow one user to be the administrator (set at the installation)
 * Asynchronous import using Redis (need to be enabled in the *Internal Settings*)

## TODO

 * Improve the LDAP integration, see [#1](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/wallabag2_ynh/issues/1)
 * Write the `backup` / `restore` scripts

## Upgrade from v1

The upgrade from the [Wallabag v1](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/wallabag_ynh)
app requires a manual operation, that's why it's provided as a new package.
For the migration process, please refer to the
[official documentation](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/migration.html).
