## Overview

It extracts content so that you can read it when you have time.

It provides a web interface, browser (Firefox / Chrome / Opera) add-ons, mobile apps (Android / iOS / Windows Phone) and even on e-reader (PocketBook / Kobo).

**Shipped version:** 2.4.0

## YunoHost specific features

In addition to Wallabag core features, the following are made available with this package:

 * Integrate with YunoHost users and SSO - i.e. logout button
 * Allow one user to be the administrator (set at the installation)
 * Asynchronous import using Redis (need to be enabled in the *Internal Settings*). RabbitMQ import not supported (yet ?)

#### Multi-users support

#### Supported architectures

* x86-64 - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/logs/wallabag2%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/apps/wallabag2/)
* ARMv8-A - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/logs/wallabag2%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/apps/wallabag2/)

## Limitations

* Removing a Yunohost's user won't delete the related wallabag user, but only desactivate it. You need to manualy remove it from wallabag before. See: https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/wallabag2_ynh/issues/39

## Additional information

**NB: Since @jeromelebleu is no longer maintaining this package, I (@lapineige) take over this repository. But I have limited time and experience, so feel free to help !**

#### Upgrade from v1

The upgrade from the YunoHost [Wallabag v1](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/wallabag_ynh)
app requires a manual operation, that's why it's provided as a new package.
For the migration process, please refer to the
[Wallabag official documentation](https://doc.wallabag.org/en/user/import/wallabagv1.html).
